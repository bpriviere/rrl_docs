# Lab Conduct

These are the professional expectations for the RRL. 

- Be respectful to each other and cultivate a healthy, hard-working, and happy work environment. 
- Send a notification with as much as advance as possible if you have to miss a lab meeting or a one-on-one meeting with the PI. It is ok if you have to miss a meeting.
- Address Ben Riviere as Prof. Ben or Prof. Riviere in emails. 
- When communicating with collaborators, vendors, NYU administration, etc. on behalf of the lab, you are representing our lab, and the expectation is professional etiquette. Here is a [link](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/academic_writing/email_etiquette.html) to some standard guidelines. An easy option is to use a reputable Large Language Model (e.g. ChatGPT) to double check your email for tone before sending.
