Welcome! 


The purpose of this documentation page is to collect and distribute internal information on the Riviere Robot Lab (RRL). 


The docs page is built on [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/), which is a documentation generator. 
The docs are written in [MyST](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), an extension of Markdown, so it should be easy for everyone to contribute.
