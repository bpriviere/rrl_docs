Welcome! 


The purpose of this documentation page is to collect information on NYU's Center for Robotics and Embodied Intelligence (CREO) such as inventory and README's for robots and equipment. 
The docs could also be extended for system-level things like onboarding, safety, etc.


The docs page is built on [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/), which is a documentation generator. 
The docs are written in [MyST](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), an extension of Markdown, so it should be easy for people to contribute.
